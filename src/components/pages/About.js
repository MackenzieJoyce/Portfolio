                <p>
                    I am a recent graduate of a full-stack coding bootcamp. My strong suit is creating web apps that are clean, simple, yet sitll have character and draw people in. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving forward, I will be honing my skills in front-end frameworks and libraries, and continuing my practice in back-end development. I am looking for work, so please feel free to meesage me regarding opportunities... Or just say hi!
